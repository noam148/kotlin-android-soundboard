Android Soundboard app
========================

On the first run it's ask for WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission. Accept the permission so it can create an new "soundboard" folder on the external storage of the device.

What can it do 
------------
* Categorized soundboard
* A search filter by filename
* Add sounds as favorites. The sound will appear also in the top categorie "favorites"

How it works
------------
* Start the app and accept WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
* Close the app and connect the device to your computer
* Go to external storage and there is a new "soundboard" folder created (if not appear, reboot device)
* Add inside soundboard folder new subfolders, that will be the categories
* And add inside the subfolders the mp3/wav files
* Run the app again, and the sounds will show there
